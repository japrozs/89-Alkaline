                        In 2020 during Covid-19 pandemic lock down in India, we
                        all realized that health is paramount in our life.
                        Everyone one around the world is talking about the
                        immunity and value of alkaline food &amp; fruits in
                        improving the same. But when we looked around and found
                        that most of our junk foods are highly acidic and doing
                        absolutely reverse and harming the inner body and
                        damaging our immunity system.

                    <p className="text-blue my-7">
                        But we all are equally responsible for this mess and
                        hold the responsibility to make this right for the sake
                        of our children, grand children &amp; future generation.

                        Thinking about Mother Nature, we embarked on a quest to
                        provide our fellow citizens and Indian community with
                        the best drinking water possible. Our water is sold in
                        bulk 20L reusable (recyclable as well) and 5L bottles to
                        reduce the impact on environment to the minimum. This
                        enables us to save the lot of bottling cost which allows
                        us to offer the pure &amp; healthy alkaline water at the
                        lowest possible cost.
